# calculator
 HTML, CSS, JS, First Project Alone

It is a simple calculator that supports some math operation ( addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, percentage );
The main data structure that is used is array. One main array and some helper arrays.
It can be made a lot easier, this is just a task with some restrictions and arrays is one of them, because i was learning them at that time.
This is my first project ever. I am still learning how things work and how to write documentation.
